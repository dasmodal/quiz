<question seconds="" points="">
  <text></text>
  <variants>
    <variant right="true"></variant>
    <variant></variant>
    <variant></variant>
    <variant></variant>
  </variants>
</question>
```
3. Fill question info:
```
<question seconds="50" points="20">
  <text>The question</text>
  <variants>
    <variant right="true">Right answer</variant>
    <variant>Wrong answer 1</variant>
    <variant>Wrong answer 1</variant>
    <variant>Wrong answer 2</variant>
  </variants>
</question>
```
